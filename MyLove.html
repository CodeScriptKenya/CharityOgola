    <div class="memories">
        <p>Every day with you is a special moment, but there are some memories that will always make my heart smile. From our first date, when I couldn't take my eyes off you, to the quiet evenings where we simply enjoyed each other's company, each moment with you is priceless. You've filled my life with joy, laughter, and love, Charity, and for that, I will always be grateful.</p>
        <p>Remember the very first day I took you to Kibra,That was one of the most romantic moments of my life, and it was perfect because I was with you. Every time we are together, it feels like time stops just for us.</p>
        <p>We've laughed until our stomachs hurt, shared secrets under the stars, and built a beautiful relationship based on love, trust, and care. I cherish every single moment we've spent together either as a couple as a friend and forever as my wife , and I am beyond excited for the many more memories we will create.</p>
